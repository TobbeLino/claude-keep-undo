 * the CodeLens path, where the row disappearing *is* the feedback, but from the
 * Quick Fix menu or the line-number context menu the menu simply closed and, if
 * the change was off-screen, nothing observable happened. And Undo's safety
 * story was invisible: the snapshot was written silently, and the user was told
 * about it only inside a dialog they may never have seen.
 *
 * So: a status bar message that costs nothing to ignore, and — after an Undo —
 * a notification whose Restore button puts the file back exactly as Claude left
 * it, still awaiting review. That is how VS Code handles its own
 * destructive-but-common actions, and it turns the snapshot machinery from a
 * guarantee into something you can actually reach.
