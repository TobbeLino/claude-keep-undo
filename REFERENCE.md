## Installation

**From the Marketplace** — search for _Keep / Undo for Claude Code_ in the
Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`), or:

```bash
code --install-extension FedeFluork.claude-keep-undo
```

**From a `.vsix`** — build it yourself (see [Development](#development)) and:

```bash
code --install-extension claude-keep-undo-<version>.vsix --force
```

---

## Quick start

1. Open a project where you use Claude Code.
2. On first activation the extension offers to install its Claude Code hooks.
   Accept for precise, real-time detection — or choose **Transcript only** and
   it works with zero configuration.
3. Let Claude edit some files.
4. Changed files get an `✳` badge in the Explorer, coloured bars in the editor
   gutter, and an entry under **Claude: Changes to Review**.
5. Review in place: click a gutter bar to open the inline Quick Diff widget and
   press **Keep** or **Undo** there, or put the cursor on a change and hit
   `Ctrl+.` / `Cmd+.`.
6. Prefer a diff view? Click the file in the changes view, right-click →
   _Open Diff of Claude's Changes_, or enable `claudeKeepUndo.autoOpenDiff`.
   For a bird's-eye pass, run **Review All Claude Changes (Multi-File Diff)**.
7. When you are done, Keep All / Undo All from the editor title bar, the changes
   view toolbar, or the Source Control title bar.
8. Too much on screen, or not enough? Run **Claude Keep/Undo: Settings and
   Setup** — every surface below can be turned on or off there, with three
   presets for the whole set.

---

## Every review surface

Claude Code edits files directly on disk. That is fast, but it leaves you
without the "here is what changed, accept or reject it" step you get from an
IDE-integrated assistant. This extension adds that step back.

### In the file you are editing

- **Change bars in the gutter.** Every line Claude touched gets a coloured bar
  in the real editor — no diff tab needed. Click one and VS Code's Quick Diff
  widget opens **inline, inside the file**, showing the original lines with
  **Keep** and **Undo** in its toolbar.
- **Inline change threads** _(optional)_. Set
  `claudeKeepUndo.inlineReview` to `comments` and each change becomes a widget
  rendered _between_ the editor lines, showing the removed and added lines as a
  unified diff with Keep / Undo in its header.
- **Quick Fixes.** Put the cursor on a change and press `Ctrl+.` / `Cmd+.` —
  _Keep this Claude change_ / _Undo this Claude change_, entirely from the
  keyboard. They appear only when the cursor is inside a change, so an unrelated
  Quick Fix elsewhere in the file is never mixed with them.
- **Line-number menu.** Right-click the line number of a change for the same two
  actions.
- **Keyboard review loop.** `Ctrl+Alt+N` / `Ctrl+Alt+P` walk to the next and
  previous change; `Ctrl+Alt+K` keeps the one under the caret, `Ctrl+Alt+U`
  undoes it. All four are scoped to files Claude has actually changed, so they
  give the keys back everywhere else.
- **Per-hunk CodeLens.** `Keep (+3 −1)` / `Undo` above each changed region, plus
  `Keep all` / `Undo all` at the top of the file — inside the diff editor by
  default, since every row displaces a line of code.

### Across the whole review queue

- **Explorer badge.** Files Claude touched are marked with `✳` and tinted with
  the Claude brand orange until you review them.
- **Status bar.** `Claude: 3 files` while anything is pending, wherever you are
  in the workbench. Click it to open everything in one diff.
- **Source Control entry.** A _Claude Changes_ provider lists every pending file
  with inline Keep / Undo and a count badge.
- **Multi-file diff.** _Review All Claude Changes_ opens every pending file in a
  single Multi Diff Editor tab — one scroll through everything Claude did.
- **Dedicated view.** _Claude: Changes to Review_ in the Explorer lists every
  pending file with a count on its header, expandable into its individual hunks —
  each row leading with the code it changes — plus global Keep All / Undo All in
  the view toolbar.
- **Side-by-side or unified diff.** Opening a file's diff compares the
  _pre-Claude_ baseline against what is on disk now, with the right-hand side
  being the real, editable file.

### Everywhere

- **Survives reloads.** State lives on disk, so closing the window or restarting
  VS Code does not lose your pending review queue.
- **Fully local.** No network calls, no telemetry, no account. Everything
  happens on your machine.
- **Stable API only.** Nothing here depends on VS Code proposed APIs, so it
  ships on the Marketplace like any other extension.

---

## What Keep and Undo do

**Keep** folds the change into the recorded baseline (the file stays as Claude
wrote it). **Undo** rewrites the file back to the baseline. Either way, once
baseline and file agree, the badge and the entry disappear.

## Undo is reversible

Undo rewrites a whole region of your file, so it is treated as a destructive
action throughout:

- **It never guesses.** A Keep or Undo whose change has moved since the button
  was drawn is refused, not applied to whatever now occupies that position. A
  baseline that cannot be established exactly is not offered for review at all.
- **It warns when your own work is at stake.** The extension cannot tell your
  lines from Claude's, so a file you have also edited is marked _edited by you_
  in the changes view, and Undo asks for confirmation naming the file.
- **It goes on the editor's undo stack.** `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` takes an Undo back.
- **It offers the way back.** Every Undo is confirmed by a notification with a
  **Restore** button that puts the file back exactly as Claude left it — content
  _and_ review state, so it is pending again rather than silently accepted.
- **It keeps a copy.** The file's content is snapshotted before every destructive
  action; run _Claude Keep/Undo: Reveal Recovery Snapshots_ to find it. Snapshots
  are kept for 14 days.

---

## How change detection works

Two complementary mechanisms, both enabled by default and independently
switchable.

### 1. Claude Code hooks — precise, real-time

The extension registers `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` hooks in
`<workspace>/.claude/settings.local.json`, matching
`Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Write` — and `Bash` as well, unless shell-command
detection is switched off.

- **`PreToolUse`** runs _before_ Claude writes. It captures the file's original
  content and stages it under `pending/`. It deliberately does **not** publish
  it as a baseline yet — at that instant the file on disk still equals the
  capture, so the extension would see "no difference" and discard it.
- **`PostToolUse`** runs _after_ the write lands. It promotes the staged copy to
  a real baseline, so the extension always computes a genuine diff.

Claude Code only loads hooks from the project the session was started in. In a
multi-root window the extension publishes `peers.json` into every folder's
state directory, and the hook photographs **each** Git repository on a `Bash`
call, writing into that folder's own queue. A sibling that is not a repository
is published with `bash: false` and skipped — it still receives Edit/Write
files that belong under it. Edit/Write of a file in a sibling folder is
captured there too, rather than dropped for being outside `--root`.

The hook script never blocks a tool call: it swallows every error and always
exits `0`.

#### Changes made by running a shell command

Claude does not only use its edit tools. It runs `sed -i`, redirects into a file,
moves and deletes things, runs a formatter or a code generator — and a `Bash`
tool call records only the command, never what it touched. Measured across this
developer's whole history, Claude Code issues about **twelve Bash calls for every
edit-tool call**, so this is not an edge case.

Git is what makes it answerable, for one reason: `git status` costs
_O(tracked files)_ while walking the tree costs _O(tree)_. On a real 69,000-file
checkout with 780 tracked files, status answers in 23 ms where the walk needs
708 — and the walk still would not say what those files used to hold. Git knows
both.

- **Before the command**, one `git status` records the commit the worktree is
  being compared against and the exact set of paths that already differ from it.
  Only those already-differing files are copied aside; in real repositories that
  is one to three files. A file that matches the last commit needs nothing
  copied, because Git is already holding its content.
- **After the command**, a second `git status` says what changed, and every
  changed file resolves to exactly one outcome: it did not exist before (the
  baseline is empty and Undo deletes it), we hold a copy taken beforehand, or Git
  holds its previous content. Anything else is listed as _not reviewable_ with
  the reason — never shown against a guess.

Content recovered from Git comes through `git cat-file --filters`, not the raw
object. In a repository with `text=auto eol=crlf` the stored object has LF line
endings while the working file has CRLF, so the raw blob is _not_ what the file
held, and an Undo built from it would rewrite every line in the file.

A command that cannot write to a file — `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `git status` and a
short list of others, with no redirect, pipe, substitution or heredoc anywhere in
it — is skipped without a snapshot. The list is deliberately tiny: a name missing
from it costs a few milliseconds, while a name wrongly on it costs an undetected
change.

**This half needs a Git repository, per folder.** A workspace folder that is
not a repository — a sibling that only holds the `.code-workspace` file and
workspace-global scripts — is skipped for shell-command snapshots. The hook is
told `bash: false` for that peer and photographs the others. Edit/Write in the
non-git folder still work. Git missing from the `PATH`, or a window whose
*every* folder is not a repository, is the case where shell-command detection
cannot run at all: the extension says so once, with the option to switch the
feature off. A mixed window never offers that switch, because it would disable
the repos that still work.

Two further cases are deliberately not covered. A command run with
`run_in_background` finishes after the hook has already sampled the filesystem,
so nothing is recorded rather than an arbitrary half. And a file written and put
back within one command is invisible to Git — correctly, since there is nothing
to review.

How much is captured is set by
[`claudeKeepUndo.detection.bashChanges`](#detection). The default,
**Files it creates**, reads no pre-existing file at all: the baseline of a file
that did not exist is not a guess, so that tier is structurally incapable of
recording a wrong one. **Files it creates and modifies** additionally copies
already-modified files aside before each command.

The hooks are registered in **`.claude/settings.local.json`**, which Claude Code
treats as personal and machine-local — the command contains absolute paths that
have no business in a committed file. If the extension updates, or the workspace
moves, the recorded command is repaired silently on the next activation.

Install or re-install them any time via the command palette:
**Claude Keep/Undo: Install Claude Code Hooks in This Project**.

### 2. Session transcript — zero-config fallback

The extension tails the session transcripts under
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/`, extracts `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit` and
`NotebookEdit` tool calls, and establishes the pre-Claude content of each file
they touch.

**Every transcript under that directory is read, not only the session's own.** A
subagent — anything launched as a Task, and every agent in a workflow — writes to
its own file one to three levels down, and its tool calls are _not_ mirrored into
the parent transcript. On this developer's machine the nested files outnumbered
the top-level ones thirty to one, and everything they changed used to be
invisible.

Where possible the content is **retrieved rather than reconstructed.** Before it
edits a file, Claude Code copies the original aside under
`~/.claude/file-history/<session>/` and names that copy in the transcript. The
copy is a byte-exact image of the file as it was, so the extension reads it
directly. Retrieval has none of the failure modes of replaying an edit list, and
it settles a question a replay cannot: when Claude Code records _no_ copy, it is
because the file did not exist — which is how a created file is recognised
without inferring it from timing.

When no copy is available — Claude Code prunes them — the extension falls back to
**reconstructing** the pre-Claude content by reverse-applying the recorded edits
to the file currently on disk.

It only reacts to edits made **from the moment the extension attaches** — it does
not replay a session's earlier history, so the review queue does not flood on
startup, and resuming an older session does not replay it either.

An edit counts only once its **result** says it happened. A tool call appears in
the transcript before the tool runs, so on its own it proves nothing: Claude Code
refuses edits whose `old_string` is not found, you can deny a call at the
permission prompt, and the same record sometimes appears twice in the file.
Reverse-applying an edit that never landed produces a baseline that never existed,
so calls are matched to their `tool_result` and committed only if it reports
success — and a call whose result never arrives makes the file _not reviewable_
rather than reconstructed from the calls that did land.

Every reconstruction is then **proved**: replaying the recorded edits forward over
the candidate baseline must reproduce the file on disk byte for byte. That proof
is necessary but not sufficient, and where it cannot decide the answer the
extension refuses instead:

- a **deletion** leaves no anchor saying where the removed text was;
- an **ambiguous replacement**, where the replacement text now occurs more than
  once;
- a **`replace_all`** edit, always — whether the replacement text already existed
  elsewhere in the file is not recorded anywhere, and both readings replay forward
  to the same content, so a rename can otherwise rewrite a line you wrote
  yourself;
- a whole-file **`Write`** whose pre-write state could not be captured, or could
  not be _proved_ to predate the write (the file's own modification time has to be
  older than the tool call, or the content read may be Claude's own output).

Files in any of those categories are listed with an explanation rather than shown
against a guessed baseline — but only when no copy was available, since a
retrieved baseline is subject to none of these refusals. **Install the hooks for
exact baselines and full coverage.**

Changes made by a shell command are seen only by the hooks — see below. The
transcript records the command and never the files it touched, so this channel
cannot detect them at all.

A `NotebookEdit` is treated as a whole-file write rather than as a cell edit. The
cell source in the tool call is not what is on disk — the `.ipynb` wraps it in
JSON with its own escaping and outputs — so replaying it would either fail to
match or, worse, match by coincidence.

Reading is byte-exact and never gets stuck. A single transcript line can be
larger than the read window — Claude reading a lockfile, or writing a large file,
produces one — and such a line is skipped with a note in the log rather than
re-read forever. Offsets are counted in bytes rather than in decoded characters,
so a read that begins inside a multi-byte character cannot shift the next line
out of alignment and lose it.

When hooks are installed their baseline wins: baseline registration is a no-op
if one already exists, so the transcript path only fills gaps.

## On-disk state

State lives in **VS Code's global storage**, keyed by the folder path — not by
the window — so the same repo keeps its review queue when opened alone or in
another workspace:

```
<VS Code globalStorage>/FedeFluork.claude-keep-undo/folders/<folder-key>/
├── baselines/<key>        original (pre-Claude) content, published after the edit
├── baselines/<key>.json   { path, ts } — makes each baseline self-describing
├── pending/<key>          staging area between the Pre and Post hook
├── pending/<key>.json     { path, ts } — expires a staging left by a denied edit
├── snapshots/<key>-<ts>   pre-Undo copies, so a destructive action is recoverable
├── bash/<slot>.json       one shell command's before-state, expiring with the command
├── bash/repo.json         the cached Git toplevel, so it is not re-derived per call
├── unreviewable/<key>.json a file the hook could not recover, and why; drained and deleted
├── ignore.json            the ignore rules, published for the hook process
├── folder.json            which workspace folder this state directory belongs to
├── peers.d/<window>.json  this window's folders (one file per VS Code window)
├── peers.json             union of every live window's registration, for the hook
└── events.ndjson          size-capped log of hook events
```

`<key>` is a truncated SHA-1 of the absolute file path. Every entry carries its
own sidecar rather than sharing an index file, because the hook process and the
extension both write here and a shared file would lose updates.

A baseline that this window does not own is **left on disk**, not deleted: another
window may still be reviewing that file (different folders, or
`trackOutsideWorkspace` off here and on there). Adding a nested workspace folder
in the _same_ window moves the recorded original from the outer folder's state
into the inner one; removing it moves it back. Opening a nested layout in
_another_ window does not move or delete those copies — merely opening a repo
must not make Keep/Undo in the first window restore nothing. Each window lists
reviews that already live in a parent or nested store, filtered by which folder
owns the file. An explicit Keep or Undo applies to the copy being reviewed,
including one inherited from a related store, so the decision is visible
wherever that entry is displayed. Passive browsing still never deletes another
window's original. Window registrations in `peers.d/` expire if that window
stops rewriting them, and an empty `peers.d` is "this folder only", not the last
combined list.

An ignore rule in this window **hides** an existing review rather than deleting
it. Workspace-scoped `ignore.patterns` in a browsing `.code-workspace` therefore
no longer wipe another window's queue; a `.keepundoignore` in the repo is still
shared, but it also only hides. New captures of ignored files are still refused.

`baselines/` and `snapshots/` hold verbatim copies of your source files —
including whatever secrets those files contain. Keeping them outside the
repository is deliberate: inside it, they are one `git add -A` away from being
committed. Run _Claude Keep/Undo: Reveal Recovery Snapshots_ to find them.

---

## Ignoring files

Some files are not worth reviewing — generated output, a lockfile, a vendored
tree — and some should not be copied aside at all, because they hold secrets.
A `.keepundoignore` in the workspace root covers both.

```gitignore
# Same syntax as .gitignore, and the same precedence: last match wins.
dist/
*.log
.env
!.env.example
```

An ignored file is **not detected at all**. No gutter bars, no entry in the
review queue, no _not reviewable_ row — and, the part that matters for a `.env`,
no copy of its content in the extension's storage. The rules are enforced in the
Claude Code hook as well as in the extension, so the file is never read in the
first place: by the time a baseline exists, a verbatim copy is already on disk,
which is too late for a promise about secrets.

### Where the rules come from

Four sources, applied in this order. The last rule that matches a path decides
it, so a later source can re-include with `!` what an earlier one excluded.

| #   | Source                                  | Setting                     |
| --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1   | `.git/` and `node_modules/`             | `ignore.useDefaults` (on)   |
| 2   | `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude`    | `ignore.useGitignore` (off) |
| 3   | `claudeKeepUndo.ignore.patterns`        | always applied              |
| 4   | `.keepundoignore` in the workspace root | `ignore.useIgnoreFile` (on) |

The file goes last because it is the project's own statement — committed, shared
with the team, and the first thing a reader of the repository will look at.
`ignore.patterns` is for rules that are yours rather than the team's; it can be
set per user or per workspace and travels with Settings Sync.

Only the `.gitignore` at the repository root is read. A per-directory
`.gitignore` further down the tree carries rules relative to _its_ directory, and
applying those from the root would exclude the wrong files.

### Syntax

The practical subset of gitignore, and nothing else — no regular expressions.

|                          |                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build/`                 | a directory, at any depth                                                                      |
| `/build`                 | anchored at the workspace root                                                                 |
| `*.log`, `temp?.txt`     | wildcards that do not cross a `/`                                                              |
| `**`                     | crosses directories: leading (any depth), trailing (everything inside), or between two slashes |
| `[abc]`, `[a-z]`, `[!a]` | character classes                                                                              |
| `!pattern`               | re-includes — but not a file whose parent directory is excluded, exactly as in git             |
| `# comment`              | and blank lines, ignored                                                                       |
| `\#`, `\!`               | an escape, for a name that starts with one                                                     |

Matching is case-insensitive on macOS and Windows and case-sensitive on Linux,
which is the rule the rest of the extension applies to paths.

### Adding a rule from the UI

Right-click a file in _Claude: Changes to Review_ (or in the Source Control
list) and choose **Stop Reviewing This File**. It writes the anchored rule for
that exact path into `.keepundoignore`, creating the file from a commented
template if it does not exist.

If the file has changes waiting, the command says so and asks first, because
excluding it takes the file out of this window's queue. The recorded original
stays on disk: another window may still be reviewing it, and removing the rule
can bring the review back. The same thing happens — with a notification rather
than a dialog — when a rule you add by hand, or one that arrives from a
colleague, starts matching a file already in the queue.

Removing a rule can restore a review that was only hidden. If the recorded
original was never captured (the file was ignored before Claude touched it),
the next edit Claude makes starts it over.

## Settings

Every surface listed above is a setting, and there are two ways to reach them.

**The setup panel.** Run **Claude Keep/Undo: Settings and Setup** (or click the
gear in the _Claude: Changes to Review_ title bar). It opens a page that shows
what is currently detected, offers three presets — **Minimal**, **Recommended**,
**Everything** — and explains what each surface costs before you turn it on. It
writes ordinary VS Code settings, so nothing there is private to the panel.

**The Settings editor.** _Extensions › Keep / Undo for Claude Code_, grouped into
_Review surfaces_, _Pending queue_, _Safety and feedback_, _Detection_ and
_Ignored files_.

_Undo All_ asks for confirmation before rewriting files. On macOS the four
keyboard shortcuts use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`, and all of them apply only while
the active editor holds a file Claude has changed.

## Known limitations

These are honest constraints of VS Code's **stable** extension API. Anything
that requires a _proposed_ API is deliberately not used, because extensions that
enable proposed APIs [cannot be published to the
Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/using-proposed-api).

- **Not Copilot's exact widget.** Copilot renders deleted lines as phantom lines
  in the document and floats Keep/Undo beside them. That specific UI lives in VS
  Code core and is not exposed to extensions at all — there is no proposed API to
  opt into. The Quick Diff widget and the comment threads used here render the
  original lines inline and host the same two actions, but with VS Code's chrome
  rather than Copilot's.
- **Two sets of gutter bars in a Git repo.** VS Code draws change bars for every
  visible Quick Diff provider. In a Git repository, Git compares against `HEAD`
  and this extension compares against the pre-Claude baseline — usually the same
  lines, so you may see both. Hide either one from the Source Control view's
  _Toggle Quick Diff Visibility_ action, or set
  `claudeKeepUndo.inlineReview` to `comments` or `off`.
  The Quick Diff widget shows one provider at a time; the **Keep** / **Undo**
  buttons appear when the widget is showing _Claude Changes_.
- **A second Source Control provider.** Registering the Quick Diff provider means
  a _Claude Changes_ entry appears in the Source Control view alongside Git. It
  is not a real SCM — there is no commit box — and it doubles as the pending-file
  list. `claudeKeepUndo.sourceControlList` empties that list; the registration
  itself has to stay for as long as the gutter bars are wanted, because they come
  from it.
- **Left-click in the Explorer is not overridable.** Use the changes view, the
  context menu, or `autoOpenDiff`.
- **Diff layout is a global setting.** VS Code has no per-editor diff layout, so
  while a Claude diff is **visible** the extension temporarily sets
  `diffEditor.renderSideBySide=false` and `diffEditor.codeLens=true`, restoring
  your values once none is on screen. Visible, not focused: clicking into another
  editor group next to the diff leaves the layout alone. Set
  `claudeKeepUndo.diffMode` to `"sideBySide"` to opt out of the inline layout.
- **CodeLens cannot be styled.** Extensions cannot color or bold a CodeLens, and
  codicons render dimmed inside one, so the only way to make Keep/Undo stand out
  is an emoji — `claudeKeepUndo.codeLensStyle: "emoji"`, off by default because
  it ignores your color theme. VS Code also computes lenses asynchronously; they
  are pre-warmed before the diff opens, but a small reflow can remain on very
  large files.
- **CodeLens is per document, not per editor.** With `codeLens: "diffOnly"`, a
  file open in both a diff tab and an ordinary tab shows the rows in both: the
  provider is given the document and never learns which editor is asking.
- **Transcript-only coverage is partial by design.** Without the hooks, an edit
  whose original state cannot be reconstructed _exactly_ is listed as
  _not reviewable_ rather than shown against a guessed baseline — including every
  `replace_all` edit, which is not reversible from the transcript at all. Install
  the hooks for full coverage.
- **User edits are detected per file, not per line.** The extension knows a file
  has been edited by you, not which lines are yours, so the Undo warning fires
  for the whole file.
- **Only UTF-8 text.** Files whose bytes do not survive a UTF-8 round trip are
  refused rather than round-tripped through a lossy decode — checked on the bytes
  themselves, so a windows-1252 source with a handful of accented characters is
  caught too. Such files are listed with an explanation, and their recorded
  original is kept rather than deleted.
- **Line endings are reviewed, not diffed.** The diff itself ignores line
  terminators, which is what keeps a Keep or an Undo from rewriting every line in a
  CRLF file. A rewrite that changes _only_ the terminators — the ordinary result of
  Claude's `Write` tool touching a CRLF file — therefore has no per-line rendering:
  it is listed as **line endings changed**, and Undo restores the original bytes.
  Restoring such a file bypasses the editor, so that particular Undo is not on the
  editor's undo stack (the recovery snapshot still covers it).
- **Very different versions collapse to one hunk.** Past a large edit distance
  the changed region is reported as a single replacement; the UI says so.
- **`diffEditor.renderSideBySide` and `diffEditor.codeLens` are temporarily
  overridden** while a Claude diff tab is open, and restored when you leave it —
  and nothing is written at all when your own value already matches. The original
  values are persisted first, per window, and put back by the next window to start
  if a crash interrupts the restore. If a write into your `settings.json` fails
  (VS Code refuses to write one that has syntax errors), you are told which key is
  affected. Still: if you disable or uninstall the extension while a diff is open,
  check those two settings.
- **`claudeKeepUndo.trackOutsideWorkspace` only reaches files under no workspace
  folder.** Sibling folders in the same window are captured by the hook via
  `peers.json`. Files outside every open folder are still filtered out of the
  hook (so a `.env` in a directory that is not in the workspace is never
  copied); the transcript channel honours the setting for those.
- **Path case is folded in memory the same way it is on disk.** On Windows the
  hook (git's `D:\...`) and the editor (`uri.fsPath`, often `d:\...`) routinely
  disagree on drive-letter casing. Keep/Undo look up the file by the folded
  path, so a shell-created file in the queue can be undone from the editor that
  opened it. Linux is still case-sensitive.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FedeFluork/claude-keep-undo.git
cd claude-keep-undo
npm install
npm run compile     # or: npm run watch
```

Press **F5** (launch configuration _Run Extension_) to open an Extension
Development Host, then open a project where Claude Code is running.

### Tests

```bash
npm run lint               # eslint + prettier --check
npm run format             # prettier --write
npm run test:unit          # pure logic, Node's built-in test runner
npm run test:integration   # drives the extension in a real VS Code
npm test                   # both
```

The unit tests cover the diff engine, the transcript baseline reconstruction, how
transcript tool calls and their results are read, the reading of Claude Code's
own pre-edit copies — including every malformed record that must be refused
rather than guessed at — the hook settings merge and registration
classification, the file IO helpers, the manifest contributions, the
transcript reader driven end to end against real `.jsonl` files, and the
multi-window behaviour of the temporary `diffEditor.*` overrides. The last two run
against a stubbed `vscode`, because every failure in the layout group was _between_
windows and the reader only resolves inside the extension host. No test framework
dependency, just `node:test`. The integration tests
download VS Code on first run and need `@vscode/test-electron` ≥ 3.1.0 (VS Code
1.110+ renamed the macOS executable). CI runs everything on Linux, macOS and
Windows.

### Packaging

```bash
npm run package     # npx @vscode/vsce package
```

`vscode:prepublish` recompiles TypeScript automatically. The result is a
`claude-keep-undo-<version>.vsix` in the project root.

## Privacy

The extension does not make network requests, collect telemetry, or send
anything anywhere. It reads your workspace files and your local Claude Code
session transcripts, and writes baselines and recovery snapshots into VS
Code's global storage (`globalStorage/folders/<hash>`), keyed by folder path
— outside your repository, never inside it.
All of it stays on your machine.

A file matched by [an ignore rule](#ignoring-files) is not read at all: the rule
is enforced inside the Claude Code hook, before the file is opened, as well as in
the extension. Put `.env`, `*.pem` and anything else you would not want copied
aside into `.keepundoignore`.
