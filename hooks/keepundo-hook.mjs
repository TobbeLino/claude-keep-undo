/**
 * Claude Code hook for the "Keep / Undo for Claude Code" VS Code extension.
 *
 * Installed for PreToolUse and PostToolUse on Edit|Write|MultiEdit. It receives
 * the hook payload as JSON on stdin and records, under the state directory the
 * extension passes in, the original (pre-edit) content of each file Claude
 * touches plus an append-only event log the extension watches.
 *
 * Usage (configured automatically by the extension):
 *   node keepundo-hook.mjs pre  --state "/path/to/state"
 *   node keepundo-hook.mjs post --state "/path/to/state"
 *
 * `--state` is VS Code's per-folder storage directory. It is deliberately not
 * derived from the payload's `cwd`: that is where `claude` was launched, which
 * differs from the folder VS Code has open whenever it was launched from a
 * subdirectory, and it would put verbatim copies of the user's source inside
 * their repository.
 *
 * In a multi-root window the extension also publishes `peers.d/` (one file per
 * window) and a combined `peers.json` next to that state. A session started in
 * one folder then photographs every workspace repo those windows want captured,
 * and routes Edit/Write files into the owning folder.
 *
 * This script must never block a tool call: it always exits 0 and swallows
 * errors, so a problem here can never interfere with Claude Code.
